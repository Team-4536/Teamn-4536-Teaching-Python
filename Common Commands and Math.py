import math
import random
exampleVar = "asasas"
anotherVar = "dfdfdfdfdfdf"

#There are a couple of commands that are helpful for manipulating variables and testing code
#The first one is print()
#It takes in strings
print(exampleVar)
#You can add multiple things if you seperate them with a +
print(exampleVar + anotherVar)
#use the run button to see this in the terminal
#make three strings and print them in one print statement



#Next there are the math commands
#To use math you need to import it at the top of the file like in this one
#In order to use them you type math. and then select the one you want out of the list of options that will pop up
#They can set something to a value like this
pi = math.pi
#Other examples are
asd = math.sin(15)
#random.randint(int,int) provides a random int between the to values you give it including those 2
#This isnt super useful in frc but it is good to know
randomNum = random.randint(1,10)

#make 4 variables and give the variables values using different math commands.
