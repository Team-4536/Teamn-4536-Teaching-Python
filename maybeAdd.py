#In python variables are not bound to one type
#For example the variable stringExample can be set to False 
stringExample = False
#However this can lead to hard to find errors so it is best practice to "type" them to give them a type
#This might not prevent all issues but it will help narrow down the source of the problem
#This is done by typing colon space then what type of variable you want too make
#Like this
typedBoolean: bool = True
typedString: str = "This is typed"
typedInt: int = 1234
