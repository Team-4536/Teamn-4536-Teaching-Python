#For Loops
#For loops will repeat something for a specified amount of times
#They use the syntax for i in range (num):
for i in range (10):
    print(i)
#This will loop through the code that many times
#Try hitting run to see that loop in action
#Can you make a for loop that will print Hello 15 times





print("-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
#While Loops
#While loops are kind of like if statements in that they take true or false statements
#Then they loop until that statement is false
#The syntax for them is while(boolean):
#It is extremely important to make sure while loops can end because they dont naturally
aNum: int = 10
while(aNum > 0):
    print(aNum)
    aNum -= 1 #Gives an end to the while loop
#Can you make a while loop that takes an integer and prints that variable multilplied by 100
#And goes untill that integer equals 0






#for loops and while loops are important to know how to do but they are basically never used in frc
