#Modulus
#Modulus is a way of manipulating ints and floats
#It is a little confusing but can be used to slim down code and remove unnecessary logic
#Its syntax is num%num and what it does is it gives the remainder you would get if you divided the first num by the second
#So 8%3 would be 2 as 8/3 has a remainder of 2
#Can you make and print 3 variables that equal 2 using the modulus command   Ex. dontUse = 8%3
