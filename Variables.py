#Variables

#Variables are made using the syntax variable name = value
#example
name = "value"
#There are four main types of variables: 
#Booleans are True/False
#Strings are lenghths of text
#Ints are integers that go to 64 bit precision
#Floats are decimals that go to 64 bit precision
#We use camel case to name variables which is capitilise the first letter of each word past the first
#Like this camelCaseExample = 5
#Here are some examples of variables
booleanExample = True 
stringExample = "example"
intExample = 123456789
floatExample = 1.23456789
#Now can you make an int called myInt with the value 197 and a string called myString with the text "I made a string!" 





#Manipulating Variables
#There are a few ways to change variables 
#The first is using = to set it to something new
#Like this
booleanExample = False
#This works for all variables

#For all int, floats, and string you  can also do variable = variable + value
stringExample = stringExample + " yay"
#Lastly for ints and floats you can do variable += value
intExample += 5
#the + in += can be replace with -,*, or / in order to to subtraction, multiplication, and division
#Now can you set myString to "wo"

#Now add "rd" to myString

#Now add 50 to myInt using +=



#Now make 5 variables with different names and manipulate each of them at least once and 3 of them twice:
